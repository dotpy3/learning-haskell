# Learning Haskell

I've decided to learn the Haskell programming language. I'll use this repo to store what I'm exercising with.

### I want to learn Haskell to. Where would you point me to?

A resource I've been often pointed is [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/). Haskell's [official websites](https://www.haskell.org/documentation) lists several other resources. If I find any relevant documentation, I'll add it to this repo.
